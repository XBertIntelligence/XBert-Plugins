The XBert MCP connects your assistant to XBert: live client ledger data, alerts, workflow and practice management. You ask in plain English; the assistant uses XBert's tools to answer, and to draft work for your review.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be technical to use it?",
    answer:
      "No. Setup is paste-one-address-and-sign-in, and from then on you type questions the way you'd ask a colleague. There's no code, no API keys and no syntax to learn.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which AI assistants work with it?",
    answer:
      "Claude on the web and Claude Desktop (via Customize → Connectors), Claude Code, and any other assistant that supports MCP connectors. ChatGPT works too, with more setting up — see Get started for what your plan and your workspace admin need to allow.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my client data safe?",
    answer:
      "You sign in with your XBert account using OAuth, so your credentials stay with XBert and the assistant inherits your XBert role — it can only see what you can see. Write actions are marked for your assistant to confirm, and every action is written to the XBert audit log. You can disconnect the assistant at any time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can the assistant change my clients' books without me?",
    answer:
      "Not without it being put to you first. Write actions — creating a bill, recording a payment, updating a contact — are validated, checked for duplicates and marked as changes to confirm, which is what makes Claude and other MCP clients stop and ask you before submitting. The approval step runs in your assistant; the permission check, the validation and the audit-log entry are XBert's.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which clients can my assistant work with?",
    answer:
      "Two things decide what your assistant can reach: your XBert role, and the client's plan. Role is the one most people think of — if you can't see a client in XBert, your assistant can't either. The second is the plan: the data and reporting tools only run for clients on an AI-enabled plan, so a client on another plan will answer for tasks, templates and notes, but not for its books. That isn't a fault when it happens; it's the plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a new account or login?",
    answer:
      "No. You connect with your existing XBert login, and your existing XBert role and permissions carry over — there's nothing new to create. If you're not on XBert yet, start at xbert.io.",
