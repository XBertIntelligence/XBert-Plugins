            use, and it picks the right ones. The areas below run across both halves of
            the week: your clients' books, and how your own practice is tracking — workload and

One thing worth knowing: questions across all your clients cover the ones on an AI-enabled plan — Financial AI or Workflow AI — and the assistant tells you which it left out.
